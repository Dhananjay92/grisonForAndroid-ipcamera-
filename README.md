Grison for Android is an Android app to view live feeds from network IP cameras like Foscam FI8910W and others.

It uses my open-source ipcam library "[grison](https://github.com/jtgeiger/grison)".  This contains a custom implementation of the Foscam network protocol, based on their published documentation.  It is freely available and distributed through Maven Central.

### How do I get set up? ###

* Installation: Install to a physical Android device or emulator.
* Configuration: Launch the app and use the Add Camera button to define the network settings of the camera: IP address/hostname, port, username, password, and a nickname for the camera.  You can add as many cameras as you like.
* The main screen will show the live feed of all configured cameras.  You can tap on an individual camera to view the feed of that single camera.
